# Better Assignment

This is a simple login and sign up page made using typescript and react using formik for form handling and validation.

## Design Choices Made

- **React & TypeScript**: Used for efficient rendering and type safety.
- **CSS for Styling**: Custom styles are written in CSS for simplicity and flexibility.
- **State Management**: State is managed using React hooks to keep the code modular and easy to manage.
- **Component-Based Architecture:**: The UI is broken down into reusable components, making the code scalable and maintainable.
  
## Assumptions

- **Node.js Version**: Node.js version 14+ is installed.
- **APIs**: All required APIs are accessible and properly configured.
  
## Limitations

- **Backend**: Currently, there is no back-end server implemented.
- **React Version**: The application may require updates to stay compatible with future versions of React.
